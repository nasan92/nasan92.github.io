okay in a second step I want to publish this app to azure.
The following steps are necessary: 
- create azure container registry
- create dockerfile and publish to registry
- create azure web app with this container
- add environment variables (tenant, client id, client secret)
- add new redirect uri to app registration
- change redirect uri in app code itself!
