## Administering Information Protection and Compliance in Microsoft 365

During my [SC-400](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/sc-400/) studies I created the following two MindMaps. 

Good to know:
- Microsoft Purview Compliance Portal [compliance.microsoft.com](https://compliance.microsoft.com) (Data security + Risk and compliance MindMap)
- Microsoft Purview Governance Portal [web.purview.azure.com](https://web.purview.azure.com)
- The new Microsoft Purview Portal: [purview.microsoft.com](https://purview.microsoft.com/)

The settings highlighted in **blue** on the Purview Compliance Portal are addressed in the **Data Security Solutions Mind Map**, while the settings highlighted in **yellow** are covered in the **Risk and Compliance Mind Map**:

## Microsoft Purview -  Data governance solutions
For the data governance solutions I have not created a separate Mind Map because the following picture from here [What are Microsoft Purview's governance solutions?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/governance-solutions-overview) explains a lot:

These governance solutions are specifically tailored for on-premises or multicloud scenarios.
