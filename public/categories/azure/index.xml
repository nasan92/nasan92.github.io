    <description><![CDATA[In the latest blog post (1/2) Setting up Azure workload identity federation with Terraform in Azure DevOps pipelines (2 Part Series) we learned how to setup Azure DevOps using Workload Identiy Federation
Because we are using a managed identity and not a service principal with a secret that has a certain lifetime, we are not directly able to run terraform from locally.
But what about using a service principal for local activities whose secret will expire after a few hours instead of months?]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I was curious about how to set up Azure DevOps to utilize Terraform for deploying Azure resources with workload identity federation instead of relying on a service principal with secrets. In this blog post, I will demonstrate how I set up this configuration.
To learn more about workload identity federation read the docs:
Workload identity federation - Microsoft Entra | Microsoft Learn
Prerequisites Azure DevOps Org &ldquo;Customer Azure Tenant&rdquo; with Subscription &ldquo;Backend Azure Tenant&rdquo; with Subscription (can be in the same tenant - in our example we use different tenants) Azure Powershell Module Overview - Setup Steps Create a storage account that will store the Terraform state file Create a managed identity which has contributor permissions on this storage account If not already the case, install the Terraform extension for your Azure DevOps Org Create a new Azure DevOps Project Create a service connection to the &ldquo;backend tenant&rdquo; using workload identity federation with your previously created managed identity Create a managed identity in the customer tenant where you finally want to deploy Azure Resources using Terraform, with Contributor permission on the Subscription Create a service connection to the customer tenant using workload identity federation with your previously created managed identity Create a repository with basic Terraform files Create an Azure DevOps Pipeline PreviewPrepare &ldquo;Backend Tenant&rdquo; to store Terraform State File As outlined in this example, I intend to store the Terraform state file in a different Azure Tenant than where the actual Azure Deployment will occur.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Azure AD App registration Recently I had some talks with developers which made me to realize that I didn&rsquo;t fully understand how App Registrations are working. I was aware that we are registering an app and allowing the app certain permissions but in detail I didn&rsquo;t understand it.
Why Azure AD App registration? Basically for every app where you want to use the Microsoft Identity Platform, you need to register your app.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-sql-automation#stop-protection
I had a case where I did need to migrate a lot of databases from one SQL Server on a Azure VM to another VM. After the successful migration there were a lot of old databases on the &ldquo;old SQL Server&rdquo; offline and I got a lot of Azure Backup Alerts. Because I was to lazy to disable the backup for each database by hand, I created the following small script which will do that job.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Yes&hellip; its annoying there is no built in role to only allow restarting of Azure Virtual Machines&hellip; The Virtual Machine Contributor Role allows to much. With this role you are able to destory and create VMs..
So what I want to do in this case is creating a custom role which only allows to start / stop / restart Virtual Machines. And I want to do that with terraform because I&rsquo;m doing the whole Azure Resource Deployment with terraform anyway.]]></description>
