In the following mind map, I attempted to visualize some core concepts of OpenTelemetry
The purpose of OpenTelemetry is to collect, process and export signals. The signals (telemetry data) which OpenTelemetry currently supports can be found on the right side of the mind map:

- Signals:
  - Traces
  - Metrics
  - Logs

The mind map illustrates the components that make up these signals and how they are interconnected.

To learn more about OpenTelemetry: 
- Official docs: [What is OpenTelemetry?](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/what-is-opentelemetry/)
- A very helpful resource to getting started with OpenTelemetry is the following course from the Linux Foundation: [Getting Started with OpenTelemetry](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/getting-started-with-opentelemetry-lfs148/)
