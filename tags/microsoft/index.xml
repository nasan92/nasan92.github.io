Because we are using a managed identity and not a service principal with a secret that has a certain lifetime, we are not directly able to run terraform from locally.
But what about using a service principal for local activities whose secret will expire after a few hours instead of months?</description></item><item><title>(1/2) Setting up Azure workload identity federation with Terraform in Azure DevOps pipelines (2 Part Series)</title><link>https://nasan92.github.io/posts/2023-09-23-azuredevopsterraform/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Sep 2023 06:10:21 +0100</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://nasan92.github.io/posts/2023-09-23-azuredevopsterraform/</guid><description><![CDATA[I was curious about how to set up Azure DevOps to utilize Terraform for deploying Azure resources with workload identity federation instead of relying on a service principal with secrets. In this blog post, I will demonstrate how I set up this configuration.
To learn more about workload identity federation read the docs:
Workload identity federation - Microsoft Entra | Microsoft Learn
Prerequisites Azure DevOps Org &ldquo;Customer Azure Tenant&rdquo; with Subscription &ldquo;Backend Azure Tenant&rdquo; with Subscription (can be in the same tenant - in our example we use different tenants) Azure Powershell Module Overview - Setup Steps Create a storage account that will store the Terraform state file Create a managed identity which has contributor permissions on this storage account If not already the case, install the Terraform extension for your Azure DevOps Org Create a new Azure DevOps Project Create a service connection to the &ldquo;backend tenant&rdquo; using workload identity federation with your previously created managed identity Create a managed identity in the customer tenant where you finally want to deploy Azure Resources using Terraform, with Contributor permission on the Subscription Create a service connection to the customer tenant using workload identity federation with your previously created managed identity Create a repository with basic Terraform files Create an Azure DevOps Pipeline Preview Prepare &ldquo;Backend Tenant&rdquo; to store Terraform State File As outlined in this example, I intend to store the Terraform state file in a different Azure Tenant than where the actual Azure Deployment will occur.]]></description></item><item><title>SC-300 - Microsoft Identity and Access Administrator - MindMap</title><link>https://nasan92.github.io/posts/2023-09-14-sc300-mindmap/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Sep 2023 05:10:21 +0100</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://nasan92.github.io/posts/2023-09-14-sc300-mindmap/</guid><description>Note: My Microsoft Cybersecurity Architect MindMap covers already a lot of topics mentioned here: SC-100 MindMap Collection

I was aware that we are registering an app and allowing the app certain permissions but in detail I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand it.
Why Azure AD App registration? Basically for every app where you want to use the Microsoft Identity Platform, you need to register your app.</description></item><item><title>SC-100 - Microsoft Certified Cybersecurity Architect Expert - MindMap Collection</title><link>https://nasan92.github.io/posts/2023-01-13-microsoftcybersecurityarchitect/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2023 10:51:21 +0100</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://nasan92.github.io/posts/2023-01-13-microsoftcybersecurityarchitect/</guid><description>Studying SC-100 In my recent self-study, I have been working through the Microsoft SC-100 learning path.
